One of her strengths is thinking through the feature or problem from a user perspective and also from a technical perspective. I've seen her build features in a smarter way rather than just the way they came about from one specific user problem. She's a great collaborator and always manages to instill excitement into the team.",

I've always found it easy to work with her, both to follow her requests, and to resolve any ad-related concerns whenever they came up. She's responsible and stays on top of things, and doesn't let them slip away whether it's in her interests or in the interests of the other party she's working with. Jaymee is very knowledgeable and is always on top of her facts. She's also very friendly and easy to talk to, which is an important characteristic to me, given how complex the world of ads is.
